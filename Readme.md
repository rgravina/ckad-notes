# CKAD Study Notes

## Introduction

In early 2021, I prepared to take the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam offered by The Linux Foundation. My previous experience with deployment platforms is mainly limited to Cloud Foundry, which I have used to `cf push` applications to production in Spring, Rails, Node and probably other frameworks too.

But Kubernetes is a little different. There are certainly similarities between what it does, and what Cloud Foundtry does, but the CLI and concepts are entirely different.

Hopefully these notes will help you in prepatation for the CKAD also. Good luck!
